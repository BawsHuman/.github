# ðŸ’ª BawsHuman Developer Experience 

BawsHuman is building a global fitness and coaching platform that empowers anyone to improve their health through personalized programs, gamified challenges, and human connection. Our goal is to unify the fragmented fitness worldâ€”across devices, disciplines, and bordersâ€”into one platform where health, performance, and community come together for real-world transformation.

## Open Source

BawsHuman contributes to the open source software movement as part of our human connection and community mission.
